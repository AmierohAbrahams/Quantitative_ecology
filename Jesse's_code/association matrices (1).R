#association matrices: how closely are sites associated with one another based on how closely the spp are related to each other 
# species: comparing sites with sites 
# transposed: comparing spp with spp, based on how present spp are within sites 
# jaccard coefficient: presence absence relativity (binary = true)
# level of dissimilarity: if one spp is present, the other is x times less likely to occur 

# = correlation matrix for env data 
# pearson correlation coefficient (+/-)
# pairwise correlation plot 
# q(patterns btwn variables) mode and r(corr) mode analysis 

# dont apply euclidian distances to spp data!
