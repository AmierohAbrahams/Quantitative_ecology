# Diversity ------------------------

# alpha: number of spp present within the smallest sampling unit (plot, transect or quardrat) - local scale 
# Bray-Curtis, Sorensen, Jaccard 
# compares similarity of one site to another site - 1 value 

# beta: how spp community similarity changes from one site to another 
# species turnover 
# Jaccard index: 
# measures how quickly things become dissimilar 

# gamma: total number of species in the sampling region 
# diversity of all samples combined 

# which diversity measures used depends on the ecological question being asked
# depends on spatial scale and nature of the landscape 
# main focus is alpha 

# Ecologial Similarity and Distance -----------------------

# distance matrix: how different is one transect from another, or how similar are they? 
# similarity and dissimilarity are inversely related to each other 
# dependent on env differences that influences spp composition 
# or unmeasured influences (residual)
# or noise 

# distance matrices: species table + environmental table 
# association/resemblance matrices 
# vegdist in vegan -- euclidean distance / bray / 
# results in pairwise differences in community structure(square matrix)
# square matrix: pairwise 

# euclidian distance only to be applied to env data 
# uses pythagorean theorem 
# results in cartesian units (x,y // x,y,z)
# 	d[jk] = sqrt(sum(x[ij]-x[ik])^2 

# want to compare distance diagonally (shortest/ direct distance) - hypotenuse of pythagorean triangle 

# ALL INFO OF SPP ID OR ENV ARE LOST!!!

# Spatial data frame â€“ cartesian coordinates
spa <- read.csv("DoubsSpa.csv", row.names=1)
